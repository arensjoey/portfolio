				<h1>Space Odyssey</h1>
				<p>This was my submission to a design contest for an outer space-themed fashion show run by the Eaton RESA Fashion department. The triangular shapes were made in Illustrator and it required a bit of finagling to get the colors to be just how I wanted them, but I think it looks alright. The “space odyssey” text is a premade Illustrator template found online, and the “2018” is a simple text box with the “VCR OSD Mono” font. This logo along with the poster did not win, however, but I’m still proud of my work. It was a fun assignment, and I’m glad that our class were able to apply our skills to the real world.

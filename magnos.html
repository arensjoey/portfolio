				<h1>Magnos</h1>
				<p>For some reason, my interests have gravitated to the realm of fantasy. This, along with my desire to practice my figure drawing, has caused me to start creating and sketching my own fictional characters. The one featured here, Magnos, was born by mistake through an error on my part while tweaking a color overlay in Photoshop. His body was originally colored red, but black was much more ominous. I ran with the idea, and after some tweaking ended up satisfied with what is now the signature Magnos gray.</p>
